<strong>American Airlines </strong>(NASDAQ: <a class="ticker" href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=AAL">AAL</a>) said Thursday it is pushing back scheduling passengers on its <strong>Boeing Co&nbsp;</strong>(NYSE: <a class="ticker" href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=BA">BA</a>) 737 MAX jetliners until April 7, adding further expense and capacity constraints to its system. The news comes one day after Federal Aviation Administration head Stephen Dickson testified before Congress that <a href="https://www.freightwaves.com/news/faa-wont-recertify-737-max-until-2020-administrator-says" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">the agency won't rush a review of corrective steps taken by manufacturer Boeing Co. and a final airworthiness recertification for the MAX</a>. The administrator also said about a dozen technical milestones must still be met before any approval is granted, pushing completion of the process into 2020. Reuters reported that the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-boeing-737max/u-s-faa-says-boeing-is-pursuing-unrealistic-schedule-for-737-max-return-idUSKBN1YG26J" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">FAA has expressed displeasure with Boeing about continuing to raise unrealistic public expectations for the plane's return to service</a>. Dickson was scheduled to meet Thursday, Dec. 12, with Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenberg to discuss the safety review. The FAA and other aviation authorities grounded the 737 MAX in March after two crashes killed 346 people. Investigations discovered that automated flight-control software received faulty signals of a stall and put the aircraft through maneuvers the pilots couldn't control because they did not have adequate training on how to react to the situation. Boeing&nbsp;officials repeatedly suggested this fall that the FAA might lift the MAX flight ban as soon as November or December. Boeing has slowed production of the MAX to 42 per month, but officials have said they might need to temporarily shut down the factory if the FAA approval process drags on. The Wall Street Journal reported last month that Boeing was trying to convince regulators to let it start delivering aircraft before new pilot training had been approved, although airlines wouldn't fly with passengers until the training was completed. American has 24 idle MAX aircraft and an additional 76 on order. In October, the Dallas-based carrier said it expects the cancellations of MAX flights to negatively impact its full-year pre-tax income by about $540 million. The MAX is more fuel efficient than previous models, and airlines have incurred other expenses, such as leasing older aircraft to fill scheduled routes or refunding the cost of tickets to passengers who don't want to fly on a MAX plane. That was before the airline blacklisted the 737 MAX from its schedule once again in November, this time through March 5, when the FAA ungrounding didn't materialize. The latest schedule revision will likely result in the cancellation of about 140 non-MAX flights as airline managers juggle aircraft to cover the MAX routes with a different aircraft to minimize the number of customers affected, American said. On Dec. 22, it will update its reservation system for passengers booked on MAX flights through April 6. Once the FAA gives the go-ahead to resume flights, airlines will require several weeks to bring parked planes up to proper maintenance standards, train pilots on the new software and work the planes into their schedules. Airlines have said they will gradually phase in 737 MAX aircraft over several weeks once they start flying. Meanwhile, <strong>Southwest Airlines</strong> (NYSE: <a class="ticker" href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=LUV">LUV</a>), which has the largest 737 MAX fleet, said it reached an agreement with Boeing on compensation for a portion of damages associated with the grounding and will share proceeds with its employees, who are likely to receive less profit-sharing income this year because of the MAX's unavailability. Further compensation talks with Boeing are continuing. Southwest said it expects to give employees about $125 million from the Boeing funds. "While still evaluating the applicable accounting principles, the Company currently expects to account for substantially all of the compensation as a reduction in cost basis of both existing and future firm aircraft orders, which will reduce depreciation expense in future years," the airline said in a statement. Southwest Airlines CEO Gary Kelly said Thursday the airline probably will need to push back the date for the MAX return to service, according to Reuters. It currently has removed the MAX from its flight schedule through March 6. Southwest operates an all-737 narrow-body fleet, but still managed to move 200 million pounds of cargo last year.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - American Airlines Group Inc &lt;AAL.O&gt; will extend cancellations of Boeing Co &lt;BA.N&gt; 737 MAX flights through April 6, it said on Thursday, a day after the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said it would not approve the plane's return to service before January. American, the largest U.S. airline, had previously canceled about 140 flights a day through March 4 and now expects to resume 737 MAX passenger flights on April 7. Once the FAA gives 737 MAX approval, American will need at least 30 days to prepare the jets and its pilots for commercial flights, airline and union officials have said. Boeing 737 MAXs have been grounded worldwide since March following an Ethiopian Airlines Co crash, the second of two fatal crashes in five months that killed 346 people. Southwest Airlines Co &lt;LUV.N&gt; Chief Executive Gary Kelly said earlier Thursday it was "likely" the carrier would need to extend its cancellations beyond early March. <br><br> (Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Richard Chang)

This article is written for those who want to get better at using price to earnings ratios (P/E ratios). To keep it practical, we'll show how American Airlines Group Inc.'s (<a target="_blank" href="https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/transportation/nasdaq-aal/american-airlines-group?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=intro&amp;utm_source=yahoo&amp;blueprint=959057" rel="nofollow noopener">NASDAQ:AAL</a>) P/E ratio could help you assess the value on offer. <strong>What is American Airlines Group's P/E ratio?</strong> Well, based on the last twelve months it is 7.75. That means that at current prices, buyers pay $7.75 for every $1 in trailing yearly profits. <span class="veryHighlightLink"><a target="_blank" href="https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/transportation/nasdaq-aal/american-airlines-group?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta&amp;utm_source=yahoo&amp;blueprint=959057" rel="nofollow noopener"> See our latest analysis for American Airlines Group </a></span> The <strong>formula for P/E</strong> is: Price to Earnings Ratio = Share Price Earnings per Share (EPS) Or for American Airlines Group: P/E of 7.75 = $27.48 $3.55 (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.) A higher P/E ratio implies that investors pay <strong>a higher price</strong> for the earning power of the business. That isn't a good or a bad thing on its own, but a high P/E means that buyers have a higher opinion of the business's prospects, relative to stocks with a lower P/E. We can get an indication of market expectations by looking at the P/E ratio. If you look at the image below, you can see American Airlines Group has a lower P/E than the average (8.9) in the airlines industry classification. This suggests that market participants think American Airlines Group will underperform other companies in its industry. While current expectations are low, the stock could be undervalued if the situation is better than the market assumes. If you consider the stock interesting, further research is recommended. For example, I often monitor <strong><a target="_blank" href="https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/transportation/nasdaq-aal/american-airlines-group?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=integrated-pitch&amp;utm_source=yahoo&amp;blueprint=959057#insider_trading" rel="nofollow noopener">director buying and selling</a></strong>. If earnings fall then in the future the 'E' will be lower. That means even if the current P/E is low, it will increase over time if the share price stays flat. Then, a higher P/E might scare off shareholders, pushing the share price down. American Airlines Group's 229% EPS improvement over the last year was like bamboo growth after rain; rapid and impressive. The cherry on top is that the five year growth rate was an impressive 51% per year. So I'd be surprised if the P/E ratio was <strong>not</strong> above average. Unfortunately, earnings per share are down 29% a year, over 3 years. One drawback of using a P/E ratio is that it considers market capitalization, but not the balance sheet. In other words, it does not consider any debt or cash that the company may have on the balance sheet. Hypothetically, a company could reduce its future P/E ratio by spending its cash (or taking on debt) to achieve higher earnings. Such spending might be good or bad, overall, but the key point here is that you need to look at debt to understand the P/E ratio in context. American Airlines Group's net debt is considerable, at 161% of its market cap. This level of debt justifies a relatively low P/E, so remain cognizant of the debt, if you're comparing it to other stocks. American Airlines Group has a P/E of 7.7. That's below the average in the US market, which is 18.6. The company may have significant debt, but EPS growth was good last year. If it continues to grow, then the current low P/E may prove to be unjustified. When the market is wrong about a stock, it gives savvy investors an opportunity.

Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldnt want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value? One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Lets put, <strong>American Airlines Group, Inc</strong>. AAL stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks: <strong>PE Ratio</strong> A key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stocks current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole. On this front, American Airlines has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 5.78, as you can see in the chart below: <br>&nbsp;<br>This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&amp;P 500 compares in at about 19.61. If we focus on the stocks long-term PE trend, the current level American Airlines puts current PE ratio below its midpoint (which is 7.07) over the past five years. <br>&nbsp;<br>Also, the stocks PE compares favorably with the Zacks Transport sectors trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 15.67. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers. <br>&nbsp;<br>We should also point out that American Airlines has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this years earnings) of 5.38, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Apple stock in the near term too.<br><br><strong>P/S Ratio</strong> Another key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stocks price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings. Right now, American Airlines has a P/S ratio of about 0.27. This is somewhat lower than the S&amp;P 500 average, which comes in at 3.39 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years. <br>&nbsp;<br>If anything, this suggests some level of undervalued tradingat least compared to historical norms.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br><strong>Broad Value Outlook</strong> In aggregate, American Airlines currently has a Value Style Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes AAL a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other metrics make it clear too. Its P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 2.96, which is noticeably better than the industry average of 5.33. Clearly, AAL is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles. <strong>What About the Stock Overall?</strong> Though American Airlines might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of C and a Momentum score of A. This gives AAL a VGM scoreor its overarching fundamental gradeof A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here &gt;&gt;<u>).</u> Meanwhile, the companys recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best. The current quarter has seen four estimates go lower in the past sixty days compared to three higher, while current year estimate has seen five upward and four downward revision in the same time period. This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has declined 3.8% in the past two months, while the current year has inched up 1% in the same time period. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below: <strong>American Airlines Group Inc. Price and Consensus</strong> American Airlines Group Inc. price-consensus-chart | American Airlines Group Inc. Quote This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.<br><br><strong>Bottom Line</strong> American Airlines is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Moreover, a strong industry rank (Top 24% out of more than 250 industries) further supports the growth potential of the stock. In fact, over the past one year, the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below: <br>&nbsp;<br>So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn favorable in this name first, but once that happen, this stock could be a compelling pick. <strong>Breakout Biotech Stocks with Triple-Digit Profit Potential</strong> &nbsp;The biotech sector is projected to surge beyond $775 billion by 2024 as scientists develop treatments for thousands of diseases.

<strong>Alibaba</strong> (NYSE:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/baba-stock-quote/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><strong>BABA</strong></a>) has been boasting rapid growth in paying subscribers for its Youku platform. In the latest quarter, the company mentioned that Youkus average paying subscribers grew 47% year-on-year. This helped Alibaba show 23% YoY growth in the Digital Media segment.<br> Source: BigTunaOnline / Shutterstock.com <a href="https://investorplace.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading Tips</a> At the same time, there has been a narrowing of losses within the Digital Media segment. This trend should improve the bullish sentiment for Alibaba stock. In the year-ago quarter, Alibaba reported 3.8 billion&nbsp; yuan EBITA losses for the Digital Media segment. In the recent quarter, this loss came down to 2.2 billion yuan, or $309 million. There has also been an improvement in EBITA margin. It increased from negative 64% in the year-ago quarter to negative 30% in the latest quarter. At this pace, Alibaba should be able to break even in this segment in 2020. Digital Media is the biggest loss-making segment within Alibaba. Rapid reduction in losses in this segment should help in boosting the overall margins, EPS and improving the momentum for Alibaba stock. Alibabas online streaming platform, Youku, has reported 47% year-on-year growth in paying subscribers. This growth has also fueled the revenue growth of 23% within Digital Media segment. In the latest quarter, the revenue base in this segment increased to 7.3 billion yuan or $1.02 billion.&nbsp; There has been a massive reduction in EBITA losses within the Digital Media segment. One of the main reasons is that the management is focusing more on return on investment and ensuring cost efficiencies. This has helped in reducing the quarterly losses from RMB 3.8 billion in the year-ago quarter to RMB 2.2 billion.&nbsp; There is a huge halo effect from the Digital Media segment. Higher user engagement on Youku helps Alibaba promote other services and monetize the customer base effectively. These new services are crucial for the future growth of Alibaba stock. It should be noted that Alibabas main competitors, <strong>JD.com</strong> (NASDAQ:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/jd-stock-quote/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><strong>JD</strong></a>) and <strong>Pinduoduo</strong> (NASDAQ:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/pdd-stock-quote/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><strong>PDD</strong></a>), will find it difficult to replicate the scale of Youku. Hence, Alibaba would be the only retailer with a very strong entertainment portfolio. This is similar to<strong> Amazons</strong> (NASDAQ: <a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/amzn-stock-quote/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><strong>AMZN</strong></a>) position in U.S. where it is the only ecommerce player with heavy content investment. <br> Youku, iQiyi and Tencent Video are the <a href="#">three major players</a> in the over-the-top (OTT) video market in China. Last year, eMarketer estimated that the market share for these three players was close to each other. Alibaba does not break down Youkus paying subscriber numbers. However, <a href="#">iQiyi reported</a> that it has crossed 100 million mark in June 2019. Similarly, Tencent Video <a href="#">reported in the latest quarter</a> that it has seen 22% year-on-year growth and has 100.2 million paying subscribers. Alibabas Youku has reported higher growth rate than Tencent Video in terms of paying subscribers. Hence, it is very likely that Youku has also crossed the 100 million mark or is very close to it. We should soon hear about the exact number of paying subscribers from the management which can provide another positive tailwind to Alibaba stock. Youkus 47% year-on-year growth is more impressive when we look at the already large base of paying subscribers. This shows the ability of Alibaba to create attractive content for its Chinese audience. Chinas social media landscape is undergoing major changes as big companies vie for higher customer engagement. Recent quarters have also shown a rapid growth in <strong>ByteDance</strong>, which has been taking market share away from Tencent in terms of user time spent. We can see in the <a href="#"><em>Bloomberg</em> chart</a> that Alibaba has a double-digit market share in the user time spent on a platform. Youku is the primary reason behind Alibabas healthy market share in this metric. It is likely that Alibaba will keep on investing in this segment to gain more paying subscribers and increase customer engagement on its overall platform. Youku also has an advantage due to its control over the content delivered on its platform. If the Chinese administration decides to further tighten up the social media regulations, it will be a challenge for Tencent and ByteDance, which have a large chunk of user-generated content. The big winner of this move will be Alibabas Youku. Alibaba stock has out-performed Tencent stock in 2019 and resolution of trade war should further <a href="https://investorplace.com/2019/11/why-alibaba-stock-should-hold-strong-in-2020/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">improve the growth prospect</a> of Alibaba stock in 2020.&nbsp; Alibabas Digital Media segment continues to show rapid improvement in a number of important metrics. Youku has posted 47% YoY growth in paying subscribers, compared to 22% growth reported by Tencent Video. Youku should be close to 100 million mark in terms of paying subscribers and is one of the top three OTT players in China.&nbsp; Alibaba has also mentioned about the massive decrease in losses in the Digital Media segment. Lower losses and good revenue growth should allow this segment to show positive EBITA by end of 2020. Youku also helps in increasing the overall user time spent on Alibabas platform. These users can be monetized using different services like retail, delivery, Alipay, and others. <em>As of this writing, Rohit Chhatwal did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.&nbsp;</em> The post <a href="https://investorplace.com/2019/12/alibaba-stock-shows-strong-tailwinds-from-higher-subscriber-growth/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Alibaba Stock Shows Strong Tailwinds from Subscriber Growth</a> appeared first on <a href="https://investorplace.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">InvestorPlace</a>.
November retail sales only rose 0.2% from October, falling sizably short of the 0.5% estimations. With unemployment at a half-century low, what is holding consumers back? Have US shoppers lost their holiday cheer or is something else to blame? Thanksgiving came on the 28th this year, the latest it could be in November. This left only 2 days for holiday shopping last month with the holiday shopping season ostensibly starting the day after thanksgiving. The retail apocalypse also played its role in Novembers softer than expected retail figures. Black Fridays Doorbusters are losing their allure to Cyber Monday. Roughly 40% of holiday shoppers said they would be doing their holiday shopping online. Waiting for Cyber Monday reduces the stress of Black Friday shopping. It is the preferred method for most Millennials and Gen Zs unless you are a deal junkie that loves the Black Friday rush. Cyber Monday occurring in December didnt help last months figures. Online shopping was up 11.5% from last November with broader retail up only 2.5%. Companies like Amazon AMZN and Alibaba BABA are reaping the benefits of the shifting consumer. Department stores that rely heavily on holiday shopping for a large portion of their sales are taking a hit. Stocks like Macys M and Kohls KSS continue to get beat up into the holiday season. Consumer spending may also be a culprit. Consumers may be holding back on hefty holiday spending as they see a foggy economic future ahead. <br>Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

I read an article on Bloomberg about <a href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/hedge-fund/holocene+advisors/971/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Holocene Advisors</a>. According to Bloomberg Holocene Advisors tripled its assets to $5.3 billion since its inception in 2017. That's probably because Holocene is a beta neutral hedge fund (I will explain what that means in a bit) and returned 9% in 2017, 3% in 2018, and 14% in 2019 through October. Brandon Haley founded Holocene Advisors in April 2017 after working at billionaire Ken Griffin's Citadel as an equity chief. Brandon Haley didn't have trouble raising $1.5 billion from clients in 2017. Holocene is a hedge fund in the true sense of the word. A real hedge fund doesn't rely on rising markets to make money. Most hedge funds are 40-70% net long, which means their betas are in the neighborhood of 0.4 to 0.7. When the entire market goes up 28%, these hedge funds go up about 40% to 70% of this figure just because they are long the market. This has nothing to do with their stock picking skills. Yet, most of these hedge funds still charge 2% of their clients' assets and 20% of their returns as fees. That's why almost everybody hates them. This is probably the biggest travesty in the financial markets. Some hedge fund managers become billionaires because they discovered a legal way of cheating investors out of their savings. Most investors are (most likely unknowingly) invested in hedge funds through their pension funds, state or local governments, or labor unions. A generation ago, there weren't a lot of hedge funds, but they generated amazing returns. Investing got harder and harder over time, and the number of truly talented hedge fund managers declined, yet the total number of hedge funds skyrocketed. Nowadays, most hedge fund managers can't generate any alpha yet manage to survive because their investors are truly dumb. Let's do a little bit of math (not too complicated, 5th grade level math) and explain how hedge funds are able to manage to trick their gullible investors. In 2019, the market return is about 28%. If you are an untalented hedge fund manager (untalented when it comes to investing, but of course you had to be extremely talented in marketing to raise billions of dollars from gullible pension funds, labor unions, and state and local retirement funds), you'd be 40-70% net long the market. This means without lifting a finger you'd&nbsp; generate 11.2% (40% of market's 28% gain) to 19.6% (70% of market's 28% gain) in gross returns. But since you are such a "gifted" hedge fund manager, you get to charge your clients a flat fee of 2 percentage points of their total assets and another 20% of their gains. Twenty percent of 11.2% is another 2.24% and twenty percent of 19.6% is 3.92%. So, you'd take away a total of 4.24 percentage points at the low end and 5.92% at the high end for being such a "brilliant" hedge fund manager in fees. That means your investors' net returns would be anywhere from 6.96% (11.2% - 4.24%) to 13.68% (19.6% - 5.92%). According to HFR, equity hedge funds returned an average of 10.24% in 2019. That's the mid point of our estimated 6.96% - 13.68% range for the returns of untalented hedge fund managers. Unbelievable!!! Don't you agree? That pretty much proves our point that most hedge fund managers aren't skilled investors. They are waaaaaaaaaaaaay too expensive. So, stay away from them. It doesn't make sense to pay 4% to 6% of your assets every year to invest in a hedge fund because most of them won't generate 10-20 percentage points of outperformance to DESERVE these sky-high fees. At Insider Monkey we basically do two things. First, we get rid of ALL of these hedge fund fees, assuming that you aren't one of our premium members who pay a few hundred dollars annually for our newsletters.

The signup box only shows up on our website. Back to Holocene Advisors. The investors in the market have been throwing money at Brandon Haley's market neutral hedge fund because market neutral hedge funds will generate 0% in gross returns if they aren't talented. Since Brandon Haley is generating positive returns while charging an arm and a leg, this implies that he generates alpha on the long and/or short side of his portfolio. This is rare nowadays. Holocene Advisors top 5 stock picks were salesforce.com, inc. (NYSE:<a href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/salesforcecom%20inc/1108524/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">CRM</a>), Linde plc (NYSE:<a href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/linde%20plc/1707925/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">LIN</a>), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:<a href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/amazon%20com%20inc/1018724/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">AMZN</a>), General Motors Company (NYSE:<a href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/general%20motors%20corp/40730/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">GM</a>), and United Technologies Corporation (NYSE:<a href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/united%20technologies%20corp/101829/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">UTX</a>) at the end of September. However, we have seen a lot of turnover among its top 5 picks so far this year. At some point this year stocks like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:<a href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/microsoft%20corp/789019/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">MSFT</a>), Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:<a href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/alibaba%20group%20holding%20limited/1577552/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">BABA</a>), and PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:<a href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/paypal%20holdings%20inc/1633917/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">PYPL</a>) also found themselves among Holocene's top 5 list. salesforce.com inc., Amazon.com Inc, Microsoft Corporation, Alibaba Group Holding Limited, and PayPal Holdings are currently among our hedge fund top 20 stock picks list. We have been tracking the performance of Holocene Advisors stock picks that have at least $1 billion in market capitalization for the past year. It is a new hedge fund, and it is very early for us to determine whether this is truly an exceptional hedge fund, but so far we haven't seen an amazing performance from this fund. Holocene Advisors' non-micro-cap US long stock picks lost an average of 16.3% during the fourth quarter of 2018, underperforming the S&amp;P 500 Index by 2.7 percentage points. During the first 9 months of 2019 Holocene's long picks as described above generated an average return of 27.1% vs. 20.4% for the S&amp;P 500 ETFs. We should clarify that our estimated returns are estimates and Holocene's actual returns will differ depending on how dramatically it changes the weights of each stock in its portfolio. Nevertheless, we see that Holocene was able to beat the market by about 6.7 percentage points on the long side. This tells us that Holocene either generates a larger outperformance on the short side of its portfolio or generates additional alpha via short term trading. Nevertheless Holocene's average long pick generates a small alpha and investors should pay attention to its picks.

When it comes to the biotech market, its not easy to show consistently strong gains. But <strong>Amarins</strong> (NASDAQ:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/amrn-stock-quote/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><strong>AMRN</strong></a>) shareholders have come to expect a certain level of outperformance. Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com Just look at the average daily return for the past five years: <a href="#">a sizzling 84%</a>! To put this in perspective, <strong>Netflix</strong> (NASDAQ:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/nflx-stock-quote/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><strong>NFLX</strong></a>) has <a href="#">gained 44%</a> and <strong>Facebook</strong> (NASDAQ:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/fb-stock-quote/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><strong>FB</strong></a>) has <a href="#">returned 20%</a> during the same period. Despite all this, Amarin is not necessarily well-known. However, it definitely has an innovative team that has focused on <a href="#">lipid science</a> for drug development. <a href="https://investorplace.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading Tips</a> This is key to Amarins success. Its lead drug, <a href="#">Vascepa</a>, is a runaway success for the biotech firm. That said, its not without its share of risk. Vascepa, which is targeted for patients with <a href="#">high levels of triglyceride</a>,&nbsp; is currently sold in the U.S., Lebanon and the United Arab Emirates. As expected, Amarin is looking to expand into other markets, including China, Canada and the Middle East. Sure, as critics have pointed out, Amarin is a one-product company that faces <a href="https://investorplace.com/2019/12/amarin-stock-gamble-on-fda-approval/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">fierce competition</a>, such as from <strong>GlaxoSmithKline</strong> (NYSE:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/gsk-stock-quote/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><strong>GSK</strong></a>). Also, it looks like <strong>AstraZeneca</strong> (NYSE:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/azn-stock-quote/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><strong>AZN</strong></a>) will make a play for the category. While its true that there are notable risks, the market opportunity is enormous. This means there is plenty of room for multiple players. Amarin also has the benefit of being a specialist and a long-term operator in the market. In fact, this has led to perhaps an even bigger opportunity for the company. Keep in mind that Vascepa has shown positive results in safely lessening cardiovascular disease that goes beyond cholesterol. This is according to <a href="https://investorplace.com/2018/09/amarin-stock-up-on-study-results/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">two landmark studies</a> during the past couple years. And if the FDA approves to expand it <a href="#">which is expected in late December</a> then it could be a gamechanger. The drug would truly be unique, and it could also represent multi-billion-dollar potential in annual revenues. Consider that in mid-November the Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee (EMDAC) of the U.S. FDA <a href="#">voted unanimously</a>&nbsp;to recommend the expanded use of Vascepa. It is true that this may not a binding decision, but it carries a lot of weight. <br> Heres what Dr. Deepak Bhatt, an executive director of the Interventional Cardiovascular Programs at Brigham and Womens Hospital Heart and Vascular Center, <a href="#">had to say</a>: The REDUCE-IT results are quite remarkable and illustrate how icosapent ethyl could transform the treatment of cardiovascular disease in the United States and worldwide. From my perspective as not only a researcher but also a practicing physician, icosapent ethyl represents one of the most important developments in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease since statins and, if FDA approved, will be a critical tool for physicians to use to help prevent cardiovascular events such as heart attack and stroke, including fatal ones, in high-risk patients. Even without the expanded use for Vascepa, Amarin has demonstrated an ability to scale its business. During the latest <a href="#">quarter</a>, total revenue soared to $112.4 million a 103% increase year-over-year. A large increase in the number of new prescriptions of Vascepa is what drove this growth, including a rise in the average prescriptions per prescriber. Additionally, the company has also shown progress with its sales organization, which has seen faster-than-expected productivity from new reps. With that said, Amarin is planning to double its sales force at the beginning of 2020. Collectively, the new use of Vascepa is key as cardiovascular disease is the No. 1 killer in the U.S. with over <a href="#">800,000 deaths per year</a> . So while there are some risks, Amarin is likely to see much growth for years to come. <em>Tom Taulli is the author of the book,&nbsp;<a href="#">Artificial Intelligence Basics: A Non-Technical Introduction</a>.&nbsp;</em><em>Follow him</em><em>&nbsp;on Twitter at&nbsp;<a href="#">@ttaulli</a>.

Every quarter Insider Monkey publishes its list of <a href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/hedge-fund/best-performing-hedge-funds/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">best performing hedge funds</a>. Our goal is to identify the best hedge funds to replicate and thus avoid large hedge fund fees. I am going to explain this point a little bit later. First, last quarter's best hedge fund: <a href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/hedge-fund/noked+capital/1100/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Noked Capital</a>. Noked Capital is an Israeli hedge fund that usually invests in Israel based stocks globally. However, they also have a small global equity fund that also invests in US stocks. According to their site "Noked Global Equity, is a long bias global equity fund focusing on investing in global shares and aspires to achieve overperformance in relation to the MSCI AC Index, without increasing the level of risk over time. The portfolio is characterized by sectoral and geographical diversification." Roy Vermus and Shlomi Bracha founded Noked Capital in November 2013 and turned it one of Israel's biggest hedge funds. According to our calculations Noked Capital's 13F positions in stocks with at least $1 billion in market cap returned 16.4% during Q3 and outperformed the S&amp;P 500 Index by nearly 15 percentage points. It was the best performing hedge fund tracked by Insider Monkey. We continuously track the performance of each hedge fund's 13F stock picks because we can't rely on their actual returns. Most hedge funds are 40-70% net long, which means their betas are in the neighborhood of 0.4 to 0.7. When the entire market goes up 28%, these hedge funds go up about 40% to 70% of this figure just because they are long the market. This has nothing to do with their stock picking skills. Yet, most of these hedge funds still charge 2% of their clients' assets and 20% of their returns as fees. That's why almost everybody hates them. This is probably the biggest travesty in the financial markets. Some hedge fund managers became billionaires because they discovered a legal way of cheating investors out of their savings. Most investors are (most likely unknowingly) invested in hedge funds through their pension funds, state or local governments, or labor unions. A generation ago, there weren't a lot of hedge funds, and hedge funds generated amazing returns. Investing got harder and harder over time, and the number of truly talented hedge fund managers declined, yet the total number of hedge funds skyrocketed. Nowadays, most hedge fund managers can't generate any alpha, yet manage to thrive because their investors are truly dumb. Let's do a little bit of math (not too complicated, 5th grade level math) and explain how hedge funds are able to manage to trick their gullible investors. In 2019, S&amp;P 500 Index returned about 28%. If you are an untalented hedge fund manager (untalented in investing, but of course you had to be extremely talented at marketing in order to raise billions of dollars from gullible pension funds, labor unions, and state and local retirement funds), you'd be 40-70% net long the market. This means without lifting a finger you'd&nbsp; generate 11.2% (40% of market's 28% gain) to 19.6% (70% of market's 28% gain) in gross returns. But since you are such a "gifted" hedge fund manager, you get to charge your clients a flat fee of 2 percentage points of their total assets and another 20% of their gains. Twenty percent of 11.2% is another 2.24% in performance fees and twenty percent of 19.6% is 3.92%. So, your total take away in fees is 4.24 percentage points at the low end and 5.92% at the high end for being such a "brilliant" hedge fund manager in fees. That means your investors' net returns would be anywhere from 6.96% (11.2% - 4.24%) to 13.68% (19.6% - 5.92%). According to HFR, equity hedge funds returned an average of 10.24% in 2019. That's the mid point of our estimated 6.96% - 13.68% range for the returns of untalented hedge fund managers. Unbelievable!!! Don't you agree? That pretty much proves our point that most hedge fund managers aren't skilled investors. They are waaaaaaaaaaaaay too expensive. So, stay away from them. It doesn't make sense to pay 4% to 6% of your assets every year to invest in a hedge fund because most of them won't generate 10-20 percentage points of outperformance to DESERVE these sky-high fees.

The signup box only shows up on our website. Back to Noked Capital. It is too early to determine whether Noked Capital is one of the truly talented hedge funds. It kind of landed in the #1 spot in our 2019Q3 rankings by luck. Noked Capital's main hedge fund invests Israel based companies and most of these stocks trade in Tel Aviv. However, some Israeli companies trade in United States. Noked Capital probably had a regular sized position in one of these companies: SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:<a href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/solaredge%20technologies%20inc/1419612/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">SEDG</a>). They had $42 million invested in this company at the end of September. Noked Capital's stock positions in non-Israeli companies were very small relative to its SolarEdge position but that's not because it likes Solaredge 40 times better than American stocks. That's probably because its global equity hedge fund's AUM was much smaller than its flagship hedge fund that only invests in Israeli stocks. In its 13F filing Noked Capital lumped its Solaredge position together with its other positions in its global equity fund. As a result, it looks like Noked Capital is allocating 44% of its 13F portfolio to SolarEdge whereas its positions in companies like Delek US Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:<a href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/delek%20us%20holdings%20inc/1351541/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DK</a>), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:<a href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/apple%20inc/320193/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">AAPL</a>), and Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:<a href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/merck%20%26%20co%20inc/310158/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">MRK</a>) get a much smaller weighting in our calculations. SolarEdge went up from $62 at the end of June to $82 at the end of September. Since its weight in the portfolio was 44%, this explains 14 percentage points of its 16% return in Q3. Heading into Q3 some of Noked Capital's biggest positions also counted stocks like Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ:<a href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/facebook%20inc/1326801/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">FB</a>) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:<a href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/alphabet%20inc/1288776/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">GOOGL</a>). Facebook Inc. didn't perform well during the quarter, but Alphabet Inc. did. Overall though, the rest of Noked&nbsp; Capital's stock picks generated an average return of close to 4% and outperformed the market. However, the outperformance margin of the rest of Noked Capital's 13F portfolio isn't enough to put it at the top of our rankings. So far, Noked Capital looks like a one trick pony that won't make the top of our rankings in Q4 or later. Its positions are mostly in large-cap US stocks and the main purpose of these positions is to provide mostly beta exposure to US stocks with a little bit of alpha generation capacity.

U.K.-based Craneware PLC (LSE:CRW) is a software company that develops, licenses and supports its automated value cycle solutions for U.S. hospitals to improve margins and enhance patient outcomes. The company generates its sales through software licenses (84.7% of fiscal 2019 revenue) and professional services, including installation and training (15.3%). Craneware was formed by CEO Keith Neilson and Gordon Graig in 1999, the same year they signed up their first customer. By the end of the next year, the total customer base amounted to over 20, and today, the company serves more than one-third of all registered hospitals in the U.S. According to the recent filing, Neilson and Craig own nearly 12.7% and 8.9% of the total shares outstanding. Derek Paterson, the chief information officer, holds around 3.3%. In our view, this current insider ownership aligns the management's interests with (minority) shareholders. <br> We particularly like the "annuity SaaS" business model at Craneware, which enables the business to generate reliable, repeatable sales. A typical license agreement lasts for five years, and the renewal rate has been over 100% in dollar value recently, with its historical norms between 85% and 115%. Superior customer loyalty is attributable to a high switching cost as well as the high quality of the product. After each sale, Craneware provides associated professional services engagement to embed the software within the customer's core processes to maximize the value the software can bring to them. While customers are being "locked in," they are also satisfied with the product and service. According to the company's website, the Net Promoter Score of Craneware is among the highest in the technology space, beating Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft Office (NASDAQ:MSFT). Furthermore, the non-cyclical nature of its clients has been making Craneware's business more bullet-proof. It should be no surprise that the company increased both its sales and operating income throughout the Great Recession (see below).<br><br> Per the chart below, Craneware delivered higher returns on assets on a more consistent basis than its peers, including Cerner (NASDAQ:CERN), CPSI (NASDAQ:CPSI), Athenahealth (NASDAQ:ATHN) and Allscripts Healthcare Solutions (NASDAQ:MDRX), indicating the management's decent capital allocation as well as the existence of a solid moat. We believe that industry tailwinds of an aging population and regulatory pressure will continue to benefit Craneware in the long run. The ongoing transition to value-based care is a powerful growth driver for the company as health care providers increasingly depend on accurate financial and operating data. In the meantime, the management at Craneware recognizes that "Build" is often the best growth strategy forward, while considering "Buy" or "Partner" complementary to expanding its portfolio of products. The company invests significantly in research and development (capital expenditures doubled in fiscal 2019), which could widen the moat and fuel long-term growth. On the risk front, the continual evolution and reform of the U.S. health care system could have a considerable impact on Craneware's market opportunities. The ongoing market consolidation among U.S. health care providers is another unfavorable trend for the company. At the same time, given that the company already serves over 30% of the current target market, we may feel some weakness in the long-term organic growth opportunities at some point. Disclosure: The mention of any stock in this article does not constitute an investment recommendation; investors should always conduct careful analysis themselves or consult with their investment advisors before acting in the stock market.

The Dow, S&amp;P 500, and Nasdaq all hit new intraday highs Thursday on the back of U.S.-China trade war positivity. This week, House Democrats also announced their support for the USMCA trade deal to replace NAFTA. Meanwhile, corporate earnings growth is set to return next year, which could help send stocks even higher in 2020 as U.S. unemployment rests at 50-year lows. With this in mind, now appears to be a good time for investors to search for stocks for 2020. One industry that seems sure to expand for years to come is technology. And within the broader tech space, cloud computing remains a growth-heavy sector. Most investors already know about the big players such as Amazon AMZN and its AWS, along with Microsoft MSFT, IBM IBM, Google GOOGL, and other tech giants. Meanwhile, cloud-based business services and software firms have expanded and its not just Salesforce CRM that has grown rapidly amid the larger technological transitions for businesses and other enterprises. &nbsp; With this in mind, we found three cloud-focused software stocks using our Zacks Stock Screener that investors might want to consider buying for 2020 <strong>Veeva Systems Inc. VEEV</strong> Veeva Systems offers cloud-based solutions for the pharmaceutical and life sciences industries. Veevas software-as-a-service model helps deliver industry-specific tools for customer relationship management, content management, and many other enterprise applications. And Veeva topped our third-quarter fiscal 2020 earnings and revenue estimates in late November. Peeking ahead, our current Zacks estimates call for the firms full-year fiscal 2020 sales to surge 26.5% to $1.09 billion. The companys fiscal 2021 revenue is then projected to jump another 27.3% higher to reach $1.39 billion. Both of these figures would top 2019 and 2018s roughly 25% top-line expansion. At the bottom end of the income statement, the cloud companys adjusted FY20 earnings are expected to surge 33% to $2.17 per share. In a sign of continued expansion, Veevas full-year fiscal 2021 EPS figure is projected to climb another 17% higher to $2.53 a share. VEEV shares have skyrocketed 155% over the last two years to crush its Internet Software Markets 15% average climb. Veeva is also up 60% in 2019 but it has moved mostly sideways during the last three months. This might actually set up a better buying opportunity for investors high on Veeva as it rests roughly 20% off its highs at the moment. VEEV holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), but has seen its longer-term earnings estimate revisions climb completely upward following its Q3 release. <strong>Anaplan, Inc. PLAN</strong> Anaplan develops cloud platforms for business applications for everything from finance to supply chains. The goal is to help customers, of which it has more than 1,300 customers worldwide, improve their planning and decision-making in real time. Anaplan topped our Q3 fiscal 2020 earnings and revenue estimates in November, with sales up 44% and subscription revenue up 47%. The San Francisco, California-based firm was also recently named to Deloittes <em>2019 Technology Fast 500</em> list. PLAN shares have climbed over 100% since the firm went public in October of 2018 and are up 90% in 2019. This crushed its Internet Software Markets average, which climbed only 16% this year. Like VEEV, Anaplan stock has slowed down, up 3.5% in the last three months to lag the S&amp;P 500s 6% move. PLAN stock opened trading Friday at $50.29 per share, which is 17% off its highs and could give the stock more space to expand heading into 2020 and beyond. Anaplan is still firmly in its growth phase and it is projected to report a full-year fiscal 2020 loss of -$0.48 per share. But this would come in far better than last years -$0.73 loss, with this positivity expected to continue next year. On top of that, PLAN has seen its longer-term consensus earnings estimates surge recently to help it earn a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Anaplans fiscal 2020 revenue is projected to jump over 44% to $346.8 million, with 2021 expected to come in 33% higher at $461.1 million. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Zuora, Inc. ZUO</strong> Zuora provides cloud-based software on a subscription basis that aims to help firms transition to their own subscription-focused models. The company hopes to capitalize on the rise of everything from Netflix NFLX to Adobe ADBE. Zuoras tagline is The World Subscribed and it sees the global economy transitioning more and more toward a subscription model. The firm has worked with everyone from cybersecurity firm Carbonite CARB to Caterpillar CAT. Mountain View, California-headquartered ZUO, which was founded in 2007 and went public in the spring of 2018, works with over 900 companies and its revenue surged 40% last year. The stock hasnt impressed investors since its early surge. But Zuora has crushed our quarterly earnings estimates by an average of 25% over the trailing four periods. This includes a 33% Q3 earnings beat on December 5, when it also raised its current full-year (2020) sales guidance. Our current Zacks estimates call for ZUOs fiscal 2020 revenues to surge over 18% to $277.7 million, with 2021 projected to jump 20% higher to reach $332 million. Meanwhile, it is expected to post a much smaller loss this year (-$0.33 vs. -$0.55), with its 2021 loss projected to shrink to -$0.19. Zuora is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) that sports an A for Momentum in our Style Scores system. ZUO is trading under $15 per share, which marks a 40% discount compared to its 52-week highs. Plus, the beaten-down stock is trading at 4.9X forward 12-month sales estimates, which marks a discount against its industrys 5.7X average. Therefore, Zuora might be a cheap tech stock to take a chance on for 2020. <strong>Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?</strong><br><br>Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.<br><br>Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Electrons arent much of a growth industry in the U.S., the second-largest electricity market in the world after China. Electricity sales rose last year, after nearly a decade of being flat or falling slightly, but are still only up 3% since 2007. There is one market, though, where demand for electrons is booming: data centers. That power-hungry growth market, though, is also where some of the worlds biggest, most capitalized and most innovative companies are bringing their might to bear. Before getting into that innovation, though, theres a crucial equation to consider: the power usage effectiveness ratio, or PUE. PUE is a measure of a data centers energy efficiency the ratio of total energy used divided by energy consumed specifically for information technology activities. The theoretical ideal PUE is 1, where 100% of electricity consumption goes toward useful computation. All the other stuff power transformers, uninterruptible power supplies, lighting and especially cooling uses power but doesnt compute, and as a result raises a data centers PUE. A 2016 Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory study listed what was, at the time, PUE for facilities at various scales: a server sitting in a room, a server in a closet, a hyperscale&nbsp;extremely large data center. The smaller the server, the higher its ratio and the lower its efficiency. For the smallest server spaces, the PUE is above 2, meaning that more than half of its energy use is for things other than computing. For hyperscale, the PUE is 1.2 meaning that most of the energy is going to computation. Here are that same data, expressed a bit differently, to show a server or data centers power consumption by use. Here you can see that the smallest applications used more power for cooling than for computation. But at hyperscale data centers, more than 80% of power consumption went to IT&nbsp;(servers, networking and storage), and only 13% went to cooling. But now, with so much computation happening in the cloud (and, in reality, in hyperscale data centers), its worth finding out what todays PUEs are and just how close they can get to that theoretical ideal of 1.0. A recent Uptime Institute survey of 1,600 data center owners and operators found that 2019s average PUE is 1.67, and that improvements in data center facility energy efficiency have flattened out and even deteriorated slightly in the past two years. That PUE means that 60% of data center electricity consumption is going to IT,&nbsp;and the rest to cooling, lighting and so on. However, some operators are doing much better than that. Google says that its data centers have a PUE of 1.1, with some centers going as low as 1.06. Theres some seasonality in play, particularly because most of Googles data centers are in the Northern Hemisphere; its Singapore data center has the highest PUE and is the least efficient of its sites. Thats not surprising given Singapore is hot and humid year-round. One key way to lower the cooling demand for a data center is to cool only to the temperature at which the machines are comfortable, not to where humans are most comfortable. For Google, thats a temperature of 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Theres another approach, and one that draws on computation itself: machine learning. Google unleashed its DeepMind machine learning platform on the problem of data center energy efficiency three years ago; last year, it effectively turned over control to its own artificial intelligence: In 2016, we jointly developed an AI-powered recommendation system to improve the energy efficiency of Googles already highly-optimised data centres. Our thinking was simple: even minor improvements would provide significant energy savings and reduce CO2 emissions to help combat climate change. Now were taking this system to the next level: instead of human-implemented recommendations, our AI system is directly controlling data centre cooling, while remaining under the expert supervision of our data centre operators. This first-of-its-kind cloud-based control system is now safely delivering energy savings in multiple Google data centres. It seems likely that more of that sort of approach will be adopted by&nbsp;Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, IBM and other major cloud computing firms. Even with efficiency gains, data center electricity demand is voracious and growing; that growth has a number of implications for the power grid and for power utilities. The first is that many of these major consumers of electricity are also contracting for wind and solar power to meet their demand. The second is that, with many data centers clustering in locations such as Northern Virginia, data center loads are becoming a meaningful share of utility peak demand in a given service territory. Recent BloombergNEF research finds that data centers could make up 15% of Dominion Energy Inc.s summer peak demand by 2024. Given that data center operators have every incentive to economize on electricity, utilities need to compete to provide service. Preferential and confidential contracts for power supply are one way to do that, with the result being that other rate payers bear the cost, as Bloomberg News reported last year. Gains in efficiency dont mean that data center demand for electricity is going down. Their scale and growth is a testament to their power usage effectiveness. Their preferential contracts for electricity, on the other hand, feel like a testament to their effective usage of a different kind of power: buying power.

I read an article on Bloomberg about <a href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/hedge-fund/holocene+advisors/971/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Holocene Advisors</a>. According to Bloomberg Holocene Advisors tripled its assets to $5.3 billion since its inception in 2017. That's probably because Holocene is a beta neutral hedge fund (I will explain what that means in a bit) and returned 9% in 2017, 3% in 2018, and 14% in 2019 through October. Brandon Haley founded Holocene Advisors in April 2017 after working at billionaire Ken Griffin's Citadel as an equity chief. Brandon Haley didn't have trouble raising $1.5 billion from clients in 2017. Holocene is a hedge fund in the true sense of the word. A real hedge fund doesn't rely on rising markets to make money. Most hedge funds are 40-70% net long, which means their betas are in the neighborhood of 0.4 to 0.7. When the entire market goes up 28%, these hedge funds go up about 40% to 70% of this figure just because they are long the market. This has nothing to do with their stock picking skills. Yet, most of these hedge funds still charge 2% of their clients' assets and 20% of their returns as fees. That's why almost everybody hates them. This is probably the biggest travesty in the financial markets. Some hedge fund managers become billionaires because they discovered a legal way of cheating investors out of their savings. Most investors are (most likely unknowingly) invested in hedge funds through their pension funds, state or local governments, or labor unions. A generation ago, there weren't a lot of hedge funds, but they generated amazing returns. Investing got harder and harder over time, and the number of truly talented hedge fund managers declined, yet the total number of hedge funds skyrocketed. Nowadays, most hedge fund managers can't generate any alpha yet manage to survive because their investors are truly dumb. Let's do a little bit of math (not too complicated, 5th grade level math) and explain how hedge funds are able to manage to trick their gullible investors. In 2019, the market return is about 28%. If you are an untalented hedge fund manager (untalented when it comes to investing, but of course you had to be extremely talented in marketing to raise billions of dollars from gullible pension funds, labor unions, and state and local retirement funds), you'd be 40-70% net long the market. This means without lifting a finger you'd&nbsp; generate 11.2% (40% of market's 28% gain) to 19.6% (70% of market's 28% gain) in gross returns. But since you are such a "gifted" hedge fund manager, you get to charge your clients a flat fee of 2 percentage points of their total assets and another 20% of their gains. Twenty percent of 11.2% is another 2.24% and twenty percent of 19.6% is 3.92%. So, you'd take away a total of 4.24 percentage points at the low end and 5.92% at the high end for being such a "brilliant" hedge fund manager in fees. That means your investors' net returns would be anywhere from 6.96% (11.2% - 4.24%) to 13.68% (19.6% - 5.92%). According to HFR, equity hedge funds returned an average of 10.24% in 2019. That's the mid point of our estimated 6.96% - 13.68% range for the returns of untalented hedge fund managers. Unbelievable!!! Don't you agree? That pretty much proves our point that most hedge fund managers aren't skilled investors. They are waaaaaaaaaaaaay too expensive. So, stay away from them. It doesn't make sense to pay 4% to 6% of your assets every year to invest in a hedge fund because most of them won't generate 10-20 percentage points of outperformance to DESERVE these sky-high fees.

The investors in the market have been throwing money at Brandon Haley's market neutral hedge fund because market neutral hedge funds will generate 0% in gross returns if they aren't talented. Since Brandon Haley is generating positive returns while charging an arm and a leg, this implies that he generates alpha on the long and/or short side of his portfolio. This is rare nowadays. Holocene Advisors top 5 stock picks were salesforce.com, inc. (NYSE:<a href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/salesforcecom%20inc/1108524/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">CRM</a>), Linde plc (NYSE:<a href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/linde%20plc/1707925/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">LIN</a>), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:<a href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/amazon%20com%20inc/1018724/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">AMZN</a>), General Motors Company (NYSE:<a href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/general%20motors%20corp/40730/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">GM</a>), and United Technologies Corporation (NYSE:<a href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/united%20technologies%20corp/101829/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">UTX</a>) at the end of September. However, we have seen a lot of turnover among its top 5 picks so far this year. At some point this year stocks like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:<a href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/microsoft%20corp/789019/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">MSFT</a>), Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:<a href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/alibaba%20group%20holding%20limited/1577552/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">BABA</a>), and PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:<a href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/paypal%20holdings%20inc/1633917/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">PYPL</a>) also found themselves among Holocene's top 5 list. salesforce.com inc., Amazon.com Inc, Microsoft Corporation, Alibaba Group Holding Limited, and PayPal Holdings are currently among our hedge fund top 20 stock picks list. We have been tracking the performance of Holocene Advisors stock picks that have at least $1 billion in market capitalization for the past year. It is a new hedge fund, and it is very early for us to determine whether this is truly an exceptional hedge fund, but so far we haven't seen an amazing performance from this fund. Holocene Advisors' non-micro-cap US long stock picks lost an average of 16.3% during the fourth quarter of 2018, underperforming the S&amp;P 500 Index by 2.7 percentage points. During the first 9 months of 2019 Holocene's long picks as described above generated an average return of 27.1% vs. 20.4% for the S&amp;P 500 ETFs. We should clarify that our estimated returns are estimates and Holocene's actual returns will differ depending on how dramatically it changes the weights of each stock in its portfolio. Nevertheless, we see that Holocene was able to beat the market by about 6.7 percentage points on the long side. This tells us that Holocene either generates a larger outperformance on the short side of its portfolio or generates additional alpha via short term trading. Nevertheless Holocene's average long pick generates a small alpha and investors should pay attention to its picks.

U.K.-based Craneware PLC (LSE:CRW) is a software company that develops, licenses and supports its automated value cycle solutions for U.S. hospitals to improve margins and enhance patient outcomes. The company generates its sales through software licenses (84.7% of fiscal 2019 revenue) and professional services, including installation and training (15.3%). Craneware was formed by CEO Keith Neilson and Gordon Graig in 1999, the same year they signed up their first customer. By the end of the next year, the total customer base amounted to over 20, and today, the company serves more than one-third of all registered hospitals in the U.S. According to the recent filing, Neilson and Craig own nearly 12.7% and 8.9% of the total shares outstanding. Derek Paterson, the chief information officer, holds around 3.3%. In our view, this current insider ownership aligns the management's interests with (minority) shareholders. <br> We particularly like the "annuity SaaS" business model at Craneware, which enables the business to generate reliable, repeatable sales. A typical license agreement lasts for five years, and the renewal rate has been over 100% in dollar value recently, with its historical norms between 85% and 115%. Superior customer loyalty is attributable to a high switching cost as well as the high quality of the product. After each sale, Craneware provides associated professional services engagement to embed the software within the customer's core processes to maximize the value the software can bring to them. While customers are being "locked in," they are also satisfied with the product and service. According to the company's website, the Net Promoter Score of Craneware is among the highest in the technology space, beating Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft Office (NASDAQ:MSFT). Furthermore, the non-cyclical nature of its clients has been making Craneware's business more bullet-proof. It should be no surprise that the company increased both its sales and operating income throughout the Great Recession (see below).<br><br> Per the chart below, Craneware delivered higher returns on assets on a more consistent basis than its peers, including Cerner (NASDAQ:CERN), CPSI (NASDAQ:CPSI), Athenahealth (NASDAQ:ATHN) and Allscripts Healthcare Solutions (NASDAQ:MDRX), indicating the management's decent capital allocation as well as the existence of a solid moat. We believe that industry tailwinds of an aging population and regulatory pressure will continue to benefit Craneware in the long run. The ongoing transition to value-based care is a powerful growth driver for the company as health care providers increasingly depend on accurate financial and operating data. In the meantime, the management at Craneware recognizes that "Build" is often the best growth strategy forward, while considering "Buy" or "Partner" complementary to expanding its portfolio of products. The company invests significantly in research and development (capital expenditures doubled in fiscal 2019), which could widen the moat and fuel long-term growth. On the risk front, the continual evolution and reform of the U.S. health care system could have a considerable impact on Craneware's market opportunities. The ongoing market consolidation among U.S. health care providers is another unfavorable trend for the company. At the same time, given that the company already serves over 30% of the current target market, we may feel some weakness in the long-term organic growth opportunities at some point.
